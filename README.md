# [Easy Notes](https://shane-notes.web.app)

I find that most apps for taking notes leave me disorganized, and bothered. There is usually too much going on, I can't understand all of the features, etc. 

I wanted to create a simple application that would let me take notes, that would be simple, fast, and would let me practice my skills with React and Firebase. This application does just that. 

## Run it locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
