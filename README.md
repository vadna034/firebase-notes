# [Easy Notes](https://shane-notes-39396.web.app)

Simple fast note taking app I created with Firebase. 

Users can login to view their notes. Save notes. Delete them. And saving occurs locally so that notes if closed without saving, users can choose to either use the version saved to the database, or the version saved locally.

## Run it locally

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### To do

Store string data hashed so that I... the firebase admin... cannot see the data
Add sharing of viewing of documents between users
